  "body": "A webapp that is based on a JAMstack approach for Triathlon Results and in the future most likely expanded to more functionality. However now this is a CRUD webapp that is serverless based on Nuxt.js. It includes FireStore, Cloudless Functions, Firebase Authentication,... to handle the functionality. UI components are mostly used from Vuetify. "
